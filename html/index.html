	<h1>Our Story</h1>
	<p>ANTHONY: It was in the middle of the night on March 10th, 2023 that I got a text from my friend, Vincent, living in Uganda. We’ve chatted before, but this time it was about a girl. He told me that she was the perfect match for me and that I should totally start talking to her. So I shot her a simple introduction text.
	</p><p>LIAHONA: Middle of March, I got a text from him, a simple “Hey’ with his name, not realizing he was the sweet guy that would eventually sweep me off my feet<span id="elipses" style="display:inline">...</span> <span id="hiddenStoryLine" style="display:none">(cheesy, right?). But talking to him felt so be-you-tiful and so therapeutic. I just felt time would pause while I talked to him.</span><div id="hiddenStory" style="display:none">
	</p><p>ANTHONY: As we began chatting, it was so natural to talk to her. Especially since it was all over text! After a few days, I asked her if I could call her on a video call at the end of the week. We both got on, and by golly did she look beautiful. The photos that Vincent had sent did not do justice to the woman I began chatting with. Her smile was so cute and genuine, and her laughter made my heart skip! We went on like this for another few weeks, just teasing, jokes, and flirting. I knew just a few things: Liahona was wonderful, and I had to go and meet her myself.
	</p><p>LIAHONA: I vividly remember the first day we talked on video call. I kept on reminding myself that I still had to get to know him more before I fell in love with him. But at that point, I couldn't stop myself from sailing on cloud nine because I was starting to fall for Anthony. So weeks later he bought a ticket to meet me in person because the feeling was mutual. I was so exhilarated to meet him, know him, and introduce him to my culture.
	</p><p>ANTHONY: I bought a plane ticket for May to not conflict with school, which left us with some more time to get to know her more. During this time, I was so pleased to learn that she shared the kinds of values that I’d been looking for! She loves God and wants her kids to abide in that love. She doesn’t like partying as she would much rather hang out at home, but loves going out to eat some good meat occasionally;) She seemed to be the most compatible woman to me than any other woman I’d met before, but I was still nervous to finally meet her! 
	</p><p>LIAHONA: Even after being oceans apart and texting daily, finally seeing Anthony felt so natural and the most memorable highlight of May. We picked up a normal and beautiful conversation so fast. Spending time with HIM proved my feelings were real and no doubt I wanted something bigger with him. I enjoyed taking walks with him (Only to the restaurants of course!), cooking for him, and getting to know him and his interests.
	</p><p>ANTHONY: I remember it well, she smelled like passionfruit, The first day, she made me a small meal of homemade Mango juice and a native delicacy called “Rolex’, and made sure I was taken care of before laying my head down to rest. We only had 20 days to spend together, but since we already knew so much about each other, everything we went out to do felt totally natural! It was as if we’d known each other for years, but were finally falling in love. She showed me where she grew up, her favorite dishes, and how she prepared them, and brought me to the Church she has attended since her childhood. Before the first week was out, I had met with her family and asked her mother for Liahona’s hand in marriage. I didn’t need more time to decide, I knew that I had found the woman I could spend the rest of my life with! She was so kind and sweet, humble yet resilient, and could raise the kind of God-fearing family that I have always wanted.
	</p><p>LIAHONA: One evening as we sat on the couch watching something, he asked a simple casual yet intimate question, “DO YOU WANT TO GO RING SHOPPING?”. It didn't hit me right away what he meant but the look in his beautiful brown eyes gave me a hint, that's when I sat up with a fast thumping heart on realizing he wanted to take the relationship to a bigger level. I nodded yes with excitement after asking him “Are you serious ?” a million times from excitement!
	</p><p>ANTHONY: Once we had the rings, Liahona and I were sure to never go out without them. We wanted it to be known that we were finally claimed! By the end of my trip, our relationship had grown into a truly beautiful engagement, and it really was the happiest I had ever been. That’s why it really stung when we had to say goodbye. We held each other for so long at the gate to the airport. I promised her that I would see her soon, and that is my goal now.
	</p><p>LIAHONA: Fast forward to 14 months later after suffering the heartache of long distance, we finally hugged each other on the 6th of July. A week later we presented our marriage unto the Lord in the Mt.Timpanogos temple.
	</p><p>Mr & Mrs. Anthony Dean Immy Liahona Beadle</p></div>
